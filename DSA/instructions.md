# Hello Everyone,

We are thrilled to announce that the **"100 Days of Code"** event is officially starting from **06/07/2025 at 12 PM**! This is an incredible opportunity to build consistency, sharpen your problem-solving skills, and grow as a developer. Here's everything you need to know:

## Event Start:
- Each day, three new questions will be provided in the `README` file of the GitHub repository.
- The questions will be updated daily at **12 PM** sharp.

## Repository Setup:

1. **Fork the Repository:**  
   - On the day the questions are released, fork the official GitHub repository to your own account.

2. **Create Your Folder:**  
   - Inside your forked repository, create a folder named after yourself.

3. **Add Your Name File:**  
   - Inside your personal folder, create a file named `[your name].md` to log your progress or reflections.
