1. Debug the code for the correct output 
for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++),This loop runs (k + 1) times instead of k times, which caused an incorrect result or early return.
The corrected loop condition should be, (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
This ensures the first pointer moves exactly k steps ahead of the second pointer, which is required for the two-pointer approach to find the kth node from the end.

2. Is it necessary to check first == NULL inside the loop?  
Yes, it is necessary.
If k is greater than the length of the list, the first pointer will become NULL before finishing the loop.
Trying to access first->next when first is NULL will crash the program.
So the check:
if (first == NULL)
    return -1;
is important to:

 # Handle invalid k values

 # Prevent runtime errors

# Return -1 safely when the list is too short
