## 1. Check if a Number is Power of 2  
A problem that introduces **bitwise logic** and demonstrates how binary representations can simplify numerical checks.  

Given a number **n**, check if it is a power of 2 using bitwise operations. A power of 2 has only **one bit set** in its binary form. This problem is commonly used to teach efficient computation using bit manipulation and highlights the use of the `n & (n - 1)` trick to verify powers of two.

This teaches **binary logic**, **bitwise operations**, and **efficient numeric checks**, which are essential for **low-level programming and competitive coding**.

**Your task:** Determine if the given number is a power of 2 using bitwise operators only.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
n = 8
```
**Output:**
```
Yes
```

---

**Input:**
```
n = 10
```
**Output:**
```
No
```

## 2. Multiply a Number by 2 Using Bitwise  
A classic bit manipulation exercise that demonstrates how to use **left shift** operations to perform multiplication efficiently.

Given an integer **n**, write a program to multiply it by 2 using only bitwise operators. This is equivalent to shifting all bits to the left by one position, a common low-level optimization technique used in systems and embedded programming.

This teaches **bitwise left shifting** and **efficient arithmetic tricks** that are useful in **performance-critical applications**.

**Your task:** Multiply the given number by 2 using bitwise operations.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
n = 3
```
**Output:**
```
6
```

**Input:**
```
n = 7
```
**Output:**
```
14
```

## 3. Divide a Number by 2 Using Bitwise  
A problem that illustrates the use of **right shift** operations to perform integer division efficiently.

Given a number **n**, write a program to divide it by 2 using bitwise shift operators. This operation discards the decimal part, making it a fast alternative to division in certain applications like graphics, embedded systems, or real-time computations.

This teaches **bitwise right shifting** and **low-level arithmetic operations** that are essential for **speed-critical systems** and **resource-constrained environments**.

**Your task:** Divide the number by 2 using bitwise operators (ignore decimals).

### Examples

**Input:**
```
n = 10
```
**Output:**
```
5
```

---

**Input:**
```
n = 9
```
**Output:**
```
4
```
